# Data-Redaction-using-Named-Entity-Recognition
The Automatic Redaction System is designed to identify and manage sensitive content in documents through Named Entity Recognition (NER). This method is essential for tagging and categorizing words based on their context within sentences.
Redaction of Personal, Confidential, and Sensitive Information

This project focuses on automating the identification and redaction of personal, confidential, and sensitive information from documents using Named Entity Recognition (NER). The increasing importance of protecting sensitive data has prompted individuals and organizations to adopt advanced methods for processing and sanitizing business documents.

Overview

In recent years, numerous data leaks from major companies have exposed sensitive information, posing serious security threats. To mitigate such risks, many organizations have implemented policies and laws to safeguard and redact sensitive data in documents. Traditional manual approaches to redact sensitive information are:

Time-consuming: Searching and matching millions of words manually is slow.

Error-prone: Manual processes are susceptible to mistakes.

This project introduces automated solutions to identify and redact sensitive information using NER techniques. Examples of sensitive entities include:

Personal names

Bank account details

Aadhaar numbers (or equivalent identifiers)

Features

Automated Identification:

Utilizes NER to recognize sensitive entities within document content.

Reduces the risk of missing sensitive terms.

Interactive Redaction:

Allows users to review and modify selected terms for redaction.

Provides flexibility to customize redaction policies.

Efficiency and Accuracy:

Automates the traditionally manual process to enhance accuracy.

Processes large volumes of documents swiftly.

Use Cases

Organizations handling sensitive customer data (e.g., banks, healthcare institutions).

Businesses complying with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.

Individuals seeking to redact sensitive information from personal documents before sharing.

Project Structure

src/: Core modules for NER and redaction logic.

data/: Sample datasets and preprocessed document examples.

config/: Configuration files for NER model settings and redaction rules.

tests/: Unit tests to ensure robustness and accuracy of the models.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python main.py

How It Works

Load the document for redaction.

The system uses a pre-trained NER model to identify sensitive entities.

Highlighted terms are presented to the user for review and optional modification.

Finalized terms are redacted in the output document.

Future Enhancements

Integration with cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive).

Support for additional languages.

Advanced customization options for entity recognition models.

Enhanced visualization for redacted content.
